## Experiment 1: Model-View-Controller Web Applications

No technical problems were met during the completion of the tutorial.

## Experiment 2: Single-page applications

After having some more time to watch tutorials and working on the assignment, I was able to understand how to implement CRUD https, create methods and bind them to the clicks on the buttons.
