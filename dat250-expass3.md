No technical problems were met during the installation.
The first few tutorials were easy to follow.

Validation of the installation package :

## Experiment 2 : Aggregation

Map-reduce example

There was one issue with this part. During the previous tutorials, MongoDB Compass was used. However, during in this part of the assignments, when I tried to use mapReduce, MongoDB Compass kept loading and was unresponsive. Consequently, for the rest of tha assignment, I used the online shell of MongoDB.

Example 1 :

Example 2 :

Additional Map-reduce operation :

This operation allows us to see how much money was made for each day where an order was made.
